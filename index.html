      <h3>Siargao</h3>
      <p>Known as the "Surfing Capital of the Philippines," the Siargao Island is well defined by it's tear-drop shape. It features stunning beaches, lagoons, rock pools, and the famous <strong>Cloud 9</strong> surfing spot. If you are to go here, prepare for activities such as island hopping, snorkeling, and diving.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="Baguio">
      <h3>Baguio</h3>
      <p>Baguio is known as the summer capital of the Philippines and the "City of Pines" and for good reason. The unusually colder weather makes it a popular hotspot for many ongoers during the summer. Locations such as the <strong>Valley of Colors</strong> makes Baguio a great escape from the heavily urbanized areas in the Philippines. </p>
